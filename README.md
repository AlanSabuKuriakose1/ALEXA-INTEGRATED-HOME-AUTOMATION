Low cost automation achieving control of five gadgets.

Try to make something activated using voice controlled than physical actions..
Just tried to make my room controlled by the AI Assistant Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen with Esp8266.

TECHNOLOGY : IOT

HARDWARE
1) Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen.
2) Esp8266( Nodemcu 1.0 )
3) Relay module (4 channel)
4) Jumper wire
5) Power supply module 5v.
6) Breadboard.
7) Case to enclose the hardware.
8) Elctric wire (1mm).
9) 2-Way DPST switches.

SERVER USED : Sinric

Just created a circuit as shown in file ( CIRCUIT ) with Esp8266 and Relay module then uploaded the code as shown in (CODE FILE) then later connected with Echo Dot
after that created a server for my room in SINRIC checked and assured that all relays are working properly.Then created some connections  directly from relay module to electric box of room.After that using the Alexa android application I just connected each applicance one by one to alexa then runned a simple test with some hand touch i successfully completed the alexa home automation directly to existing electic housed wiring.

Have a try on it.
